        <h2>THE AMULETS</h2>
        <p>The 7 amulets are the center of everything.They haved given tremendous power to upon SOF, but it is also what keeps them weakened and imprisoned. Assimilating their power and getting rid of them is the way to move towards the final goal.</p>
        <p>The 7 must split into pieces across the world to find the chosen successor that SOF has been searching for since the beginning of time.</p>
        <p>This game could be humanity’s last chance to fulfill the SOF’s plan.</p>
        <p>Each of the 7 puzzles is divided into 7 pieces, 49 that are necessary to complete the game.</p>
        <p>However, SOF sees that humanity has grown. To find the heir he must sacrifice the energy that remains to do the unthinkable. SOF has multiplied most pieces. Some are still unique.</p>
